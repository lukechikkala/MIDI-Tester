# MIDI-Tester
The program sends MIDI on & off notes to the selected MIDI Interface.

The primary goal of this program is to demo how MIDI works in other software applications, in my case, [gMA3](https://www.malighting.com/grandma3/).

# How does it work?

The core component that is actually sending MIDI data is [SendMIDI](https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI) developed by [Geert Bevin](https://github.com/gbevin).
